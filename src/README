TBBlue fork of ZEsarUX: ZESERUse

This is Ped7g's quick-hack temporary fork of ZEsarUX (emulator created by Cesar Hernandez Bano).

The goal of this fork is to provide up-to-date (feature wise) and medium-to-highly accurate emulation of ZX Spectrum Next (tm) (aka TBBlue machine), with focus on SW developers, i.e. it may eventually bail out if some SW is using feature incorrectly with error message (can't recall already doing this, but it may happen), rather then trying just to emulate what would the HW board do in such case and somehow limp forward. The focus of this fork is solely TBBlue machine - I may by accident break emulation of other machines and if that happens, it's basically "won't fix" situation, use the official ZEsarUX for other machines.

Also the performance and code clarity is not important, performance because this is not intended to be used by end users (as replacement of board) and the original ZEsarUX is already struggling a bit with fully featured TBBlue board, to get much better performance it would need complete redesign of architecture and probably offload some of the tasks to GPU or make them parallel (which is not trivial when you are emulating single core 8bit computer, and needs different architecture of underlying emulation engine, and mostly it has to be planned since beginning to achieve better results than current version, otherwise such extension may easily degrade the performance instead of improving it), plus most of the fixes were written just to produce correct result, not taking performance implications into account. Code clarity is left out, because Cesar can't accept large code changes from other contributors, it does not suite his work-flow and mind and the emulator source would quickly become to him difficult to maintain, so changes done to this fork are not expected to land to main ZEsarUX (not in direct form of pull request, although of course they are available as demonstration of what the TBBlue machine is supposed to do and Cesar is free to use this as source of information, inspiration and reuse any code he likes, to write his own version of fixes for the main ZEsarUX) - this is also the reason why this fork is "temporary", once Cesar will implement feature-full TBBlue in main ZEsarUX, this fork will be quickly abandoned and left to rot, I don't want to properly maintain this fork in the future.

And finally I'm linux user and used to build SW from source, so I'm NOT planning to release binaries for this fork - doesn't make sense on linux, and I don't have other Mac or Windows computer, so I can't easily build and test the final binaries for those operating systems. This also means most of the changes are tested only in linux, if I break something in other OS, I will never know about it, nor I will know how to fix it or test such fix (just fix it yourself and create pull request with fixes).

The amount of work, effort and passion, put into ZEsarUX, by Cesar is beyond impressive, and his release of sources under GPLv3 license allowed this quick-hack fork to be done within weeks of time instead of probably years (actually I'm not even in position to write full TBBlue emulator from scratch, so there would be none at all). While I personally dislike some parts of its source code and UI/UX, and often comment on those pieces in negative way, it is important to remember the project as whole being of tremendous value to me, and those negative points are just tiny part of my (probably pointless) way trying to reach perfection in everything. But I have huge respect for Cesar and the work he done.
